Students' Result Analysis Using Python
A data analysis project exploring factors influencing student performance using Python.

# Overview
This project aims to analyze the factors affecting student performance. Using a dataset of student demographics, parental background, and academic scores, the analysis provides valuable insights into gender trends, parental education impact, and study patterns. It demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques using Python.

# Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships.
Visualizations to represent data patterns effectively.

# Key analyses:
Gender distribution and academic performance.
Impact of parental education on scores.
Weekly study hours correlation with performance.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Visualizations.
Seaborn: Advanced statistical plots.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains:

Gender: Male/Female.
Parental Education: Education level of parents.
Parental Marital Status: Marital status of parents.
Math and Reading Scores: Student performance metrics.
Weekly Study Hours: Time spent studying each week.

# Insights
Gender Distribution: Female students are more represented, but performance differences are minimal.
Parental Education: Higher parental education correlates with better student scores.
Marital Status: Little to no direct impact on student performance.
Study Hours: Consistent study habits lead to better outcomes, though quality matters over quantity.
